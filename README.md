# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This is my first machine learning project using **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on real data.

## 📘 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Loaded and explored the California housing dataset  
2. Trained a Linear Regression model  
3. Evaluated performance using MSE and R² Score  

## 📊 Results
- R² Score: ~0.7  
- Visualization: Actual vs Predicted Prices plot  

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Use advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost  
- Deploy with Streamlit for live predictions
